## Rock, Paper, Scissors App

This is a project created in JavaScript. It's intended purpose is to simulate the game of Rock, Paper and Scissors. 

When you open a page, you should see an app as below:

### How to use?

Click one of three buttons - Rock, Paper or Scissors. The App will select one randomly. If you beat it, you win it. 

![An example of win](RPS3.jpg?raw=true "page example")

It is possible for you to also lose, just as seen on the screen below.

![An example of lose](RPS2.jpg?raw=true "page example")

Additionally, it is also possible to tie.

![An example of tie](RPS4.jpg?raw=true "page example")

Finally, the App tracks your score.
